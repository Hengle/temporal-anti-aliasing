# Temporal Anti-aliasing
My personal flavor of our TAA implementation from Unity's
[Cinematic Image Effects](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/cinematic-image-effects)
package

## A word of caution
This is a research oriented, heavily futuristic, next-gen playground for
Unity's TAA implementation. If you'd like to stay official and stable, please
use the officially distributed version from Unity's very own
[Cinematic Image Effects](https://bitbucket.org/Unity-Technologies/cinematic-image-effects)
repository.
